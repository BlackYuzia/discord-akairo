# Argument Prompting

### Please Try Again

You may notice prompting for arguments in other bots (Tatsumaki) or bot frameworks (Commando).  
Akairo has a flexible way for you to do them too!  
It allows you to set the following properties:

- How many times the user can retry.
- How long they can stall the prompt for.
- The input to use to cancel a prompt (default is `cancel`).
- Whether or not the prompt is optional.
- The message to send on start, on retry, on timeout, on maximum retries, and on cancel.
  - There can be embeds or files too!
  - Or you can have no message at all!

Let's start with a basic prompt.  
We will be reusing this command:

```ts
import { Command } from "discord-akairo";
import { GuildMember, Message } from "discord.js";

export default class HighestRoleCommand extends Command {
  public constructor() {
    super("highestRole", {
      aliases: ["highestRole"],
      args: [
        {
          id: "member",
          type: "member",
          default: (message: Message) => message.member
        }
      ],
      channel: "guild"
    });
  }

  public override exec(message: Message, args: { member: GuildMember }): Promise<Message> {
    return message.reply(args.member.roles.highest.name);
  }
}
```

First, remove the `default`.  
Since prompting will have the user retry until it is finished, `default` won't do anything.  
Now, add the `prompt` property with the options you want.

```ts
import { Command } from "discord-akairo";
import { GuildMember, Message } from "discord.js";

export default class HighestRoleCommand extends Command {
  public constructor() {
    super("highestRole", {
      aliases: ["highestRole"],
      args: [
        {
          id: "member",
          type: "member",
          prompt: {
            start: "Who would you like to get the highest role of?",
            retry: "That's not a valid member! Try again."
          }
        }
      ],
      channel: "guild"
    });
  }

  public override exec(message: Message, args: { member: GuildMember }): Promise<Message> {
    return message.reply(args.member.roles.highest.name);
  }
}
```

Simple as that, you have a prompt.  
Guess what, you can use a function for those messages too!

```ts
args = [
  {
    /* ... */
    prompt: {
      start: (message: Message) => `Hey ${message.author}, who would you like to get the highest role of?`,
      retry: (message: Message) => `That\'s not a valid member! Try again, ${message.author}.`
    }
  }
];
```

More complex structures can also be returned as well.  
This includes embeds, attachments, anything that can be sent.

```ts
args = [
  {
    /* ... */
    prompt: {
      start: (message: Message) => {
        const embed = new MessageEmbed().setDescription("Please input a member!");
        const content = "Please!";
        return { embed, content };
      };
    }
  }
]
```

### Cascading

Prompts can also "cascade" from three places: the command handler, then the command, then the argument.  
For the command handler or the command, we would set the `argumentDefaults` option.

```ts
this.commandHandler = new CommandHandler(this, {
  directory: "./commands/",
  prefix: "?",
  argumentDefaults: {
    prompt: {
      timeout: "Time ran out, command has been cancelled.",
      ended: "Too many retries, command has been cancelled.",
      cancel: "Command has been cancelled.",
      retries: 4,
      time: 30000
    }
  }
});
```

Those prompt options would now be applied to all prompts that do not have those options already.  
Or, with a command with similar arguments:

```ts
import { Command } from "discord-akairo";
import { Message } from "discord.js";

export default class AddCommand extends Command {
  public constructor() {
    super("add", {
      aliases: ["add"],
      args: [
        {
          id: "numOne",
          type: "number",
          prompt: true
        },
        {
          id: "numTwo",
          type: "number",
          prompt: true
        },
        {
          id: "numThree",
          type: "number",
          prompt: true
        }
      ],
      defaultPrompt: {
        start: "Please input a number!",
        retry: "Please input a number!"
      }
    });
  }

  public override exec(message: Message, args: { numOne: number; numTwo: number; numThree: number }): Promise<Message> {
    const sum = args.numOne + args.numTwo + args.numThree;
    return message.reply(`The sum is ${sum}!`);
  }
}
```

Rather than repeating the text for all three arguments, there is a default prompt that applies to all three.  
Their `prompt` property still has to be truthy in order to actually prompt, of course.

### Modifying

Prompts can then be modified with a modify function.  
It is most useful inside the `argumentDefaults` option, such as on the command handler.

```ts
this.commandHandler = new CommandHandler(this, {
  /* ... */
  argumentDefaults: {
    prompt: {
      modifyStart: (message: Message, text: string) => `${text}\nType cancel to cancel this command.`,
      modifyRetry: (message: Message, text: string) => `${text}\nType cancel to cancel this command.`,
      timeout: 'Time ran out, command has been cancelled.',
      ended: 'Too many retries, command has been cancelled.',
      cancel: 'Command has been cancelled.',
      retries: 4,
      time: 30000
    }
  }
}
```

The options `modifyStart`, `modifyRetry`, etc. are used to modify those types of prompts.  
With the above options, all `start` and `retry` prompts will have "Type cancel to cancel this command." appended after it.
